# Save-Image-With-Description
Tired of manually renaming images when saving them from the web? Save Image with Description is your solution! This lightweight Chrome extension automatically extracts descriptive text—such as captions, alt text, or nearby descriptions—from images on any webpage and uses it to name your downloaded file.

Key Features:

	•	Automatic Filename Generation: Saves images using their on-page description for easy organization.

	•	Intelligent Extraction: Searches for captions in <figcaption> elements, sibling elements with common caption classes, or the image’s alt/title attributes.

	•	Dynamic Content Handling: Works with pages that load images dynamically, ensuring you never miss a caption.

	•	Easy-to-Use: Right-click any image and select “Save Image with Description” from the context menu.

	•	Privacy-Focused: Processes all data locally—no external servers or data collection.
